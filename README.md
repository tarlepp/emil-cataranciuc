# Issue

One person was asking following question on Symfony Slack workspace;

```
xxx zzz  18:50
Could please someone help me solve the following problem with conversion from 
ArrayObect to array: https://3v4l.org/BePPC
```

After we discussed about that issue for a while, I just created this repository
to show how that could be done.
